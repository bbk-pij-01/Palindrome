Palindrome
==========

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of units that may be read the same way in either direction. Examples of strict palindromes include “ABBA”, “madam”, “radar”, “kayak”, and “step on no pets”. Write a program that reads a text and detects whether the text is a strict palindrome.
